# Project Structure

Phexora Cash uses the `PhexoraCash` checkout, `cash` deployment ID and
`cash.phexora.ai` host. [Publication identity](../README.md#publication-identity)
defines the publication prerequisites.

## PDF build contract

The [receive-floor supplement](ResearchEvaluation/README.md) retains its config
and source-bound analytic output under `Documentation/ResearchEvaluation/`.
It is an internal exploratory screen, not an active paper, implemented wallet
or approved T006/T305 result. Its evidence remains separate from the active
papers and does not approve their receiving or transport profiles.

- Root-level Markdown files in `papers/zkprivacy/` are the authoritative active
  publication sources; same-name PDFs are generated artifacts.
- The current working papers contain unreleased clarifications to the listed
  0.5.4/0.4.0 baselines. Their status sections distinguish these edits from a
  released revision; campaign evidence must bind exact source/artifact hashes.
- Active sources select DocWizard's `scientific` style in YAML front matter.
  The normative specification and verification guide retain their explicit
  section numbers.
- Markdown outlines under `papers/zkprivacy/templates/` are planning artifacts.
  They are excluded from the PDF build and public completed-paper list.
- Markdown records under `papers/zkprivacy/decisions/` are research and reuse
  gates. They are linked evidence, not active papers, and are excluded from the
  PDF build.
- `build-pdfs.sh` and `build-pdfs.bat` require the adjacent DocWizard-Pro
  repository's prepared `.venv` runtime and invoke its canonical
  `Src/universal_converter.py` entry point. Both scripts discover active
  root-level Markdown sources instead of maintaining a duplicated paper list.

## Production measurement

- `cash.phexora.ai` owns a dedicated SiteBuilder analytics identity and
  exact allowed origin; it is not grouped with another static website.
- The SiteBuilder-generated runtime remains off until explicit analytics
  consent and records page views plus named research-document CTAs without
  form contents.
- Aggregate reports are linked to the internal BusinessPlanner workspace.

## Production publication

The repository deployment keeps `/var/www/phexora-cash` as the registered restore
source. Production Nginx serves the stable SiteBuilder domain alias
`runtime/main/publication-domains/cash.phexora.ai`; SiteBuilder atomically
moves that alias to the deployment of the currently assigned site when its
owner or a publisher selects Publish. TEST remains repository-owned at
`/var/www/phexora-cash-test`.
